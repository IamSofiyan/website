# [transformadoras.dev] (https://transformadoras.dev) 🏳️‍⚧️✨

How many transgender people in technology can you name without any prior research? Do you know their biographies, their achievements? The ** Transformadoras ** project celebrates trans people in technology by retelling and gathering in a repository the stories of the impact they make or once made in the area - from generalized dynamic handling instruction to initiatives that help make our discussion environments safer collaboration for everyone.

## What do we use to build our website?
* 🧰 ** Framework: ** [Hugo] (https://gohugo.io) (version 0.73.0)
* 🎨 ** Theme: ** a fork of [Creative Portfolio] (https://github.com/transformadoras/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme)
* 🚀 ** Release: ** [Netlify] (https://netlify.com)

## How do we manage the content?
### Data storage
Hugo offers support for [storing personalized data in the `data` folder] (https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/#the-data-folder) through YAML, JSON and and TOML files that can be referenced HTML files dedicated to page generation. We chose to use JSON files ([JavaScript Object Notation] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)) to receive the information needed to assemble the biographies of trans people by the lowest learning barrier, best readability and positive experiences that one of our maintainers had in a similar use case. These files help us better control factors such as the minimum set of information for creating a biography (photograph, nationality, history) and the appearance and layout of each item on the page where it will be displayed.

### Managing the pages
The framework also offers [a list template] (https://gohugo.io/templates/lists/) to render multiple pages of the same category and an [individual page template] (https://gohugo.io/templates / single-page-templates /) to control the look and feel of a page in a specific category. We have not yet decided on the strategy we will use to categorize the biographies we will receive, but understanding the two models mentioned is essential for building one.

## Creators
This project is the result of a conversation and a friendship between [Juliana Dias] (https://github.com/juuh42dias) and [Anna e só] (https://github.com/contrexexample), two trans people in technology. It is built with a lot of love and care directly from the heart of Brazil.
